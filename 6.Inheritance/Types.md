# Inheritence and its types-


Inheritance is one of the most important and most exclusive features of OOPS  i.e we can define , derive  &  create a child class 
In terms of another parent class which allows the Child class to inherit and use all the non-private features  (properties and methods) 
of the parent class also have some new features of its own. 

The best real life example is a child who inherits some of the features from his parents and develops some of his own new qualities.

The same is applied to Inheritance in OOPS.

The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.

A child class inherits all the non private features of the base class but with following exceptions –



a)Constructors and Destructors of the parent class.

b) Overloaded operators of parent class. 

c) The friend function of the parent class.(A friend function is a function that can access the non-public members of a class, even though the function itself is not a member of the class.) 


#Types of Inheritance –

a)Single level inheritance- One parent ,  one Child

b)Hierarchical – One parent class but multiple children classes.

b) Multiple Inheritance –One child can inherit from various parents(classes).

c)Hybrid Inheritance – Mixture of all Inheritances.

d) Multi-level Inheritance – Grandparent , parent , child relationship
