It is one of the most important and most exclusive features of OOPS  i.e we can define & create a child class 
In terms of another parent class which allows the Child class to inherit and use all the non-private features  (properties and methods) 
of the parent class also have some new features of its own. 

The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.

A child class inherits all the non private features of the base class but with following exceptions –



a)Constructors and Destructors of the parent class.

b) Overloaded operators of parent class. 

c) The friend function of the parent class.(A friend function is a function that can access the non-public members of a class, even though the function itself is not a member of the class.) 


Types of Inheritance –

a)Single level inheritance- One parent ,  one Child

b)Hierarchical – One parent class but multiple children classes.

b) Multiple Inheritance –One child can inherit from various parents(classes).

c)Hybrid Inheritance – Mixture of all Inheritances.

d) Multi-level Inheritance – Grandparent , parent , child relationship
